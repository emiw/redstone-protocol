Please make sure to add tests for anything you add or fix. You can run the tests and lint your code with:

```sh
npm run test
```

Please also make sure to keep code coverage reasonably high. You can run coverage with:

```sh
npm run test:cov

# You also can generate a full HTML report

npm run report && open ./coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

And lastly, for development, you can auto-run tests when something changes with:

```sh
npm run watch
```
